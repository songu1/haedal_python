>I hate watching you laughing  
with all your crew  
I decided to not to give a f___ now  
when you people talked shits   
and made fun of me  
I was so helpless, couldn't do a thing  
when will someone ever say no to you,   
f___ boi  
you think this is funny, don't you  
there is someone, who can't eat or pray   
'cause of you
I just can't deal with it    
I really hate you  
but somehow,   
I could teach you some more  
you're making yourself go crazy  
whether you meant it or not  
I really hate you    
but somehow  
I hope you know   
that I'm the only one who truly cares   
and gives a f___ about you  

>I just can't deal with it  
I just can't deal with you  
I just can't deal with it  
I hate watching you lie to other people  
I decided not to give a f___ though  
but what you say is all full of shit   
even your best friends   
don't believe in you  
when will someone ever   
speak the truth to you? f___ them,  
you think I'm crazy, don't you?  
there are so many things you overlooked   
for what you've done    
I really hate you  
but somehow,   
I could teach you some more  
you're making yourself go crazy  
whether you meant it or not  
I really hate you  
but somehow  
I hope you know   
that I'm the only one who truly cares   
and gives a f___ about you  

>getting into someone's life is so easy  
but also hurting is so easy  
so you never change   
or learn to be better  
all losers come like a nightmare  
but I'm tougher and I'm wiser  
I'm strong enough to get through you  
'cause a person like me   
writes better songs  
after people like you  
I really hate you  
but somehow,   
I could teach you some more  
you're making yourself go crazy  
whether you meant it or not  
I really hate you  
but somehow  
I hope you know   
that I'm the only one who truly cares  
and gives a f___ about you
I hope you know   
that I'm the only one who truly cares   
and gives a f___ about you
